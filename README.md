# PO File Merger

A Python tool to batch-merge `.po` translation files for games like World of Tanks.  
It syncs English and Russian `.po` files by always **replacing Russian translations with their English counterparts** where available, preserving unmatched Russian entries.
Made to the easier mering .po files to MirTankov. Can be used for other games too.

## Features

- Processes all `.po` files from a `ru` (Russian) folder.
- For each Russian file:
  - If a matching English file exists in the `en` folder, Russian translations are replaced with the English ones (`msgstr`).
  - If no English file is found, the Russian file is copied unchanged.
- Output files always retain the Russian filename and are saved to a `merged` folder.
- English files that do **not** have a Russian original are skipped (with a warning message).
- **All required folders** (`en`, `ru`, `merged`) are created automatically if missing.
- Provides clear terminal output about what actions were taken for each file.

##Usage
1. Prepare your folders and files
Place your Russian .po files in a folder named ru.

Place your English .po files in a folder named en.

You do not need to create the merged folder; the script will create it automatically if it doesn't exist.

Your folder structure should look like this:


project_folder/
│
├── merge_po_files.py
├── en/
│     ├── yourfile_en.po
│     └── ...
├── ru/
│     ├── yourfile_ru.po
│     └── ...


2. From your project folder, run:
python merge_po_files.py

Example Output
account_dashboard.po: Merged, replaced 24 entries.
settings.po: English version of the file not found. Copied Russian file as-is.
user_profile.po: Russian version of the file not found. Skipped, no file saved in merged.
Done! All merged files saved in 'merged' folder.


"Edge" Cases
If a file exists in ru/ but not in en/, it is copied unchanged to merged/.

If a file exists in en/ but not in ru/, it is skipped—no file will appear in merged/, and a warning is printed.

All folders (en, ru, merged) are created if missing, so you never get a "folder not found" error.

The script detects and warns if it finds a possible language mismatch (e.g., if an "English" file appears to contain Russian or vice versa).
